# One container [Bluz](https://github.com/bluzphp/skeleton) docker image

This image was inspired by [this one](https://github.com/nazar-pc/CleverStyle-CMS/tree/master/docker)

# Usage

In order to use it you need docker installed. More info can be found [here](http://docs.docker.com/mac/started/)

If you have docker installed then run `docker build -t loginwashere/bluz-one-dockerfile .` in this directory.
Instead of image name you can use something else.

After image has been built you can tun it using command `docker run -p 80:80 loginwashere/bluz-one-dockerfile`.

Now you can access skeleton in your browser on this url - http://localhost/ .
